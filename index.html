            I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Security+ CERT and plan to pursue Network+ and CySA+ in the future. This blog is intended to provide helpful insight for others studying cybersecurity or planning to enter the field. Whether you're preparing for certifications or simply interested in cybersecurity, the goal here is to provide information.
